#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! EPG layer of iptv-rs.
//!
//! - [`XmltvParser`]: sans-IO, incremental XMLTV parser. Feed it bytes in
//!   any chunking (plain or gzip); it yields [`XmltvChannel`] and
//!   [`XmltvProgramme`] records, skipping malformed entries with counted
//!   [`ParseWarnings`].
//! - [`MatchIndex`]: maps playlist channels ([`ChannelKey`]) to EPG channel
//!   ids by tvg-id, then by normalised name, with manual [`Override`]s.
//! - [`MatchFilter`]: before a feed is matched, which of its EPG channels
//!   some playlist channel could match (a streaming import keeps only
//!   their programmes).
//! - [`SourceBuilder`] / [`GuideStore`]: compact per-channel schedules from
//!   several sources with priorities, retention and O(log n) guide queries.
//!   [`ScheduleRules`] are their ordering, overlap and retention rules, for
//!   stores that settle a schedule outside memory; [`SettledBuilder`]
//!   reads such a settled schedule back without sorting it again.
//!
//! No NSH, no platform APIs, no clock, no blocking I/O; builds for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Times are unix seconds ([`UnixTime`]) and every
//! time-dependent call takes `now` from the caller.
