//! The rules that turn one EPG channel's raw programmes into its schedule,
//! shared by [`crate::SourceBuilder`] (in memory) and stores that stream a
//! feed to disk, so both keep exactly the same programmes:
//!
//! 1. As each programme arrives ([`ScheduleRules::admit`]): one whose stop
//!    is not after its start, or that ended before the retention cutoff, is
//!    dropped.
//! 2. Of several programmes with the same start, the longest is kept (a
//!    missing stop counts as shortest; equal ones: the first in input),
//!    see [`ScheduleRules::replaces`].
//! 3. Per channel, in start order ([`ScheduleRules::settle`]): a missing
//!    stop becomes the next programme's start, a programme running into the
//!    next one is cut at the next start; then one still without a stop, one
//!    that ended before the cutoff, or one that does not fit the compact
//!    slot (more than ~136 years from the channel's first start or long) is
//!    dropped.
