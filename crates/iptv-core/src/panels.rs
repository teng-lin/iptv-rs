//!
//! As observed in the reference UX: OK shows the info card (logo, number
//! and name, programme, times with one progress line, next programme,
//! stream badges) with a row of action cards beneath it; Left/Right move
//! along the cards, OK presses one, OK with none focused (or Back) hides
//! them. Long OK or Menu shows the full control strip. A channel change
//! shows a compact banner that takes no input and hides after a few
//! seconds. A replayed programme's card shows its seek bar in place of the
//! progress line ([`Line`]): one time line on screen, never two.
//!
//! Every input restarts the auto-hide timer. Times are milliseconds on the
//! caller's monotonic clock, so this stays portable (no clock access here).
