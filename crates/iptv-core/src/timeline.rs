//! The guide's timeline under a finger, a mouse and a wheel: where the
//! programme grid is panned to, in fractional guide minutes, free of UI so
//! the rules are unit-tested on the host.
//!
//! A drag decides its axis once it moved [`SLOP`] (a tap's small wobble
//! stays a tap; a vertical drag stays the channel list's), then moves the
//! view with the finger; released fast enough it flings on and slows down
//! ([`FRICTION`]). The view stays within what the schedule can browse
//! ([`crate::guide::Schedule::browsable`]): back to the oldest day kept, on
//! to a little past the last programme. Keys move the focus model's window
//! ([`crate::guide::Focus`]); the view follows it while nothing pans, and a
//! settled pan hands its window back ([`Timeline::window`]).
//!
//! The grid draws a [`Band`] of programmes around the view and slides it
//! by the view's offset in it, so a pan rebuilds cells only when the band
//! moves (every [`MARGIN`] or so), not every frame.
