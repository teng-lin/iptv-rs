//! Multiview: up to four channels at once, one of them *active* (its sound
//! plays, the others are muted; the remote's focus is on it).
//!
//! The screen holds just the tiles ([`Layout`]): no empty cells, and the
//! tiles flow again at once when one comes or goes. One tile sits centred
//! at half the width, two side by side, three as two above one, four two
//! by two. A tile can be *enlarged*: big at the top, the others in a strip
//! under it; enlarging another moves the big place to it, reducing it
//! brings the grid back, and moving the focus leaves it be.
//!
//! The arrows move between tiles; OK (or a tap on the active tile) opens
//! its menu (`menu.rs`): try again (when it failed), add a screen from the
//! channel list or the search screen (while another fits), change
//! channel, pause or play that tile alone, enlarge or reduce (with two or
//! more), full screen, remove (with two or more). Long OK (a long press on
//! a tile) enlarges or reduces directly. A tap on another tile makes it
//! active. Remove acts at once and the sound moves to a remaining tile.
//! Back closes a dialog, else leaves multiview to the active tile in full
//! screen.
//!
//! Full screen is a *detour*: that tile plays full screen while the
//! session stays as it was (tiles, channels, the enlarged one, the active
//! one), and [`Multiview::resume`] brings the grid back. The tile moves
//! to surface 0 (the full-screen player) for it, trading surfaces with the
//! tile that had it; the other tiles keep playing, hidden and muted, so
//! the way back opens nothing. What ends a detour is the caller's rule.
//!
//! Opening starts
//! with the playing channel as the only tile and asks for the next one at
//! once (cancelling leaves the one tile); a short key hint shows until a
//! key or a few seconds pass (the caller times it).
//!
//! Each tile keeps the player surface it was given (0 to [`MAX_SURFACES`]
//! − 1; the first tile starts on surface 0, the full-screen player), so
//! adding, removing, replacing, enlarging or reflowing never disturbs the
//! other tiles' streams. Adding past the account's connection limit asks
//! first; once the viewer insists it does not ask again in this multiview.
//! Channels are the caller's (`C`); nothing here plays anything.
