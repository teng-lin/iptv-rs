//! Player health for one playback session: retries with backoff, stall
//! detection, and when the viewer sees a waiting pill or a failure card.
//!
//! A live channel never dead-ends on a failure that a retry can fix: after
//! the fast attempts it retries slowly for as long as it is the session's
//! (the channel stays selected). The card shows only for a failure retrying
//! cannot fix ([`super::Cause::Fatal`]), for a stream that played after it
//! has been down [`RetryPolicy::card_after_ms`], and for one that never
//! played once the fast attempts are used up; behind the card the retries
//! go on every [`RetryPolicy::background_delay_ms`], and the stream plays
//! again by itself when the provider lets it. Catch-up keeps a finite
//! policy: a programme that played retries the fast attempts (the app
//! reopens it where it was), one that never played fails at once (a dead
//! archive must not loop).
