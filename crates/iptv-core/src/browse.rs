//! The guide screen's columns, left to right: the navigation rail, the
//! groups column and the guide grid ([`Focus`] owns the remote's place in
//! all three).
//!
//! - Left from the guide's floor programme (the oldest replay on a
//!   catch-up channel, now's programme on one without:
//!   [`crate::guide::floor`]) shows the groups column and, beside it, the
//!   rail (collapsed to icons); the guide shifts right. Hold Left (Tab on a
//!   keyboard) shows them from anywhere in the grid ([`Focus::open_groups`]).
//! - Moving over the groups previews each one: the guide shows that list
//!   at once, from its first row ([`Outcome::Preview`]). OK chooses it: the
//!   columns close and the list's first channel has the focus, with a hint
//!   card. Right goes to the guide without moving the row. A tap selects a
//!   group as moving onto it does.
//! - Left from the groups focuses the rail (it expands with labels) on
//!   Search: Left, Left, OK searches. Items without a screen in this
//!   build are dimmed and skipped.
//! - Back: hint card → guide (a past or future programme returns to now
//!   first, unless [`Columns::back_to_now`] is off) → groups → rail →
//!   leave the app.
//!
//! An empty list (no favourites yet) cannot be entered: the focus stays in
//! the groups column while the guide explains how to add some.
