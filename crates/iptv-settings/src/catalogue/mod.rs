//! iptv-rs's settings catalogue: every setting and command, grouped by
//! section, plus lookups and the UI tree.
//!
//! The capability set and its structure follow the reference player's
//! settings screens, section by section, as they were observed;
//! keys, choice families, defaults and wording are iptv-rs's own. Each
//! row's comment records where its default comes from.
//!
//! Not settings: per-playlist provider data (URL, credentials, name, EPG
//! sources and assignments), the parental PIN (a secret), and customisation
//! overlays (names, favourites, hidden, blocked, order) live in their own
//! stores.
